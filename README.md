A custom WordPress plugin named **Featured Professor**, developed as part of the Udemy course on WordPress development. This plugin allows users to display a featured professor's information by selecting a professor from a dropdown in the block editor and rendering their details on the frontend.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This plugin introduces a new block type called Professor Callout to the WordPress block editor. The block allows users to select a professor and display a short description with a link to their full profile. The plugin also uses a custom REST API route to fetch the HTML content dynamically based on the selected professor.

Key features:

- Block registration for the Gutenberg editor.
- Dropdown to select a professor from the list of professor posts.
- Fetching professor information using a REST API route and rendering it in the block editor.
- Storing the selected professor's ID in the post meta to display related content.
- Frontend rendering of the professor's information using a custom callback function.
